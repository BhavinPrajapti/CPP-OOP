# CPP-OOP

Welcome to the **CPP-OOP** repository! This repository is a collection of various C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practice projects. These projects are designed to help you improve your OOP skills and understand how to apply them in different real-world use cases.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains the following folders and projects:

- **Advanced Healthcare Management System**
- **Advanced Vehicle Rental Management System**
- **Advanced Warehouse Management System**
- **Dev_ElectronicDevices**
- **Dev_Library**
- **Employee Management System**
- **Exam Projects (2019-2023)**
- **GPT-BookStoreManagement**
- **GPT-CompanyDatabaseManagement**
- **GPT-ComplexReservationSystem**
- **GPT-EventManagement**
- **GPT-FleetManagement**
- **GPT-LibraryEasy**
- **GPT-OnlineAuctionSystem**
- **GPT-SmartCityInfrastructureManagementSystem**
- **GPT-SmartGardenManagementSystem**
- **GPT-SmartHomeEnergyManagementSystem**
- **GPT-University**
- **GPT-Zoo**
- **PocoConcepts**
- **Shopping_Management_GPTGenerated**

Each folder contains its own set of C++ files and is dedicated to a specific use case. The projects range from simple OOP implementations to more advanced systems involving multiple classes and complex interactions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BhavinPrajapti/CPP-OOP.git
```

Once cloned, navigate to the folder of the project you are interested in and explore the C++ files.

### Running the Projects in Eclipse

If you are using Eclipse for your C++ development, follow these steps to set up and run the projects:

1. **Install Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers**: If you haven't already, download and install Eclipse IDE from the [official website](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

2. **Import the Project into Eclipse**:
   - Open Eclipse and select your workspace.
   - Go to `File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace`.
   - Select the root directory of the cloned repository and choose the project you want to import.
   - Click `Finish`.

3. **Configure the Project**:
   - Right-click on the project in the Project Explorer.
   - Go to `Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings`.
   - Configure the compiler and build settings if necessary (e.g., GCC or MinGW).

4. **Build and Run**:
   - Click on the `Build` icon (the hammer) to build the project.
   - Once the build is successful, click the `Run` button to execute the program.

### Running from the Command Line

If you prefer to run the projects from the command line, you can compile and run the C++ files using your preferred compiler. Here’s an example using `g++`:

\`\`\`bash
g++ -o output_file_name source_file.cpp
./output_file_name
\`\`\`

For more complex projects, refer to the specific project folder’s instructions.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run the C++ projects, make sure you have the following installed:

- **C++ Compiler**: GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio C++ Compiler
- **Eclipse IDE** (for Eclipse users)
- **CMake** (optional, for projects that may use it)
- **Make** (optional, for projects using Makefiles)
